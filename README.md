Telecom Customers Churn Prediction using machine Learning Algorithm

These Project Includes  Exploratory Data Analysis, and preparing the data for machine learning models. 
I implemented and evaluated various classifiers, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naive Bayes. 
The models were evaluated using AUC scores and ROC curves
